UNIX system is made up of 3 layers:
Kernel - Controls resources of the machine
Shell - Interface between users and the kernel, interprets commands
Utilities - Useful programs, like editors and compilers

UNIX system programs are the building blocks to create things.
UNIX is unique in that you can combine the blocks in many ways to do many different things.

A fundamental concept is "pipelining", which lets multiple programs be chained together so that data flows from one program to the next.

UNIX has a lot of key features that make programming easier, including format-less files, hierarchical directory structure, ability to pipeline commands, and device-independent I/O.

A file in UNIX is just a sequence of bytes. Its main attribute is its size, but there is not a lot of extra attributes to store (unlike other systems). UNIX organizes files into a hierarchy of directories, which allows users to navigate/group information easier. Note I/O devices are also treated as files.

The shell interprets commands and executes files in the file system. The ability to put commands into files and execute them simplifies repetitive tasks. The shell also handles redirection of a program's output, letting us send or receive data to/from files.
