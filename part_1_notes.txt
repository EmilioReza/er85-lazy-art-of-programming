Differences between my Git Bash terminal and a CLEAR session:

Bash:
Prompt is emili@Emilio_Laptop <directory>\n$
Prompt and ls (default) has color
Minimal install, does not include commands like man

CLEAR:
Prompt is [er85@<system> <directory>]$ where the system name varies when connecting at different times
Prompt and ls (default) has no color
Initial connection has a lot of text in the terminal
